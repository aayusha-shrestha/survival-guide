            Applying to colleges and universities can be fun, like choosing your one-stop boba shop. You try all these
            different flavors by visiting the shop and meeting the people and staff, you find out the pros and cons of
            each drink and environment, but one thing will always be the ultimate decision of choosing your forever boba
            spot, the cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            And like a boba shop, colleges and universities have the same restrictions. Thankfully, there are
            opportunities that can help relieve the financial struggle that comes with choosing higher education. But
            each system is different, making the overall process very confusing for any student when applying for
            financial aid. We will review the different ways to apply for financial aid in North America.
          </p>

          <h2>College in US</h2>
          <p>
            For a college student in the United States, there will always be one go-to method for financial aid, which
            is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, otherwise known as FAFSA (College Board, 2023). The FAFSA
            form is a type of financial aid that students request from the federal government. Think of it as a loan,
            you ask the government for a certain amount of money to pay off your schooling, and in return, they expect
            you to pay off that loan after you graduate or when you leave school, in order to give you enough time to
            find a source of income to pay off those pesky expenses, this is known as the student loan repayment plan
            (Federal Student Aid, 2023).

            Dorm rooms can have the classic arrangement of two single beds, bunk beds, or even a two-bedroom suite.
            These rooms are determined by the price, depending on location, amount of roommates, and availability of
            scheduling, so make sure you follow your school’s registration periods to get your room. Something to
            consider is the bathroom and food situation, where some students can have their own private bathroom and
            kitchenette area, others must share a public bathroom and kitchen with the whole floor. And while some
            universities provide cleaning services for both private and public bathrooms, sometimes students must be
            responsible for cleaning not only their personal rooms, but the bathroom as well ( Marie, 2018).
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you figure out your general living preferences, it’s time to find roommates! Most school ’s will
            usually pair students randomly using a questionnaire about students’ personal living situations. It is
            important for students with accommodations to reach out to their school, especially for students who
            identify with a specific gender, practice a certain religion, or are a disabled person. And if you still are
            worried about the school selection process, then most school’s allow you to pick your roommate! You can
            choose a friend or reach out to your school’s social media pages that help students find roommates ahead of
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            When committing to a residence hall, make sure you read the school’s guidelines, especially if you feel
            uncomfortable at any point when committing to a dorm. School’s can always try to accommodate students by
            moving them to different dorm rooms if there is a long-term issue among roommates, but if students would
            like to move off-campus at any point of the academic year, a student may not be able to depending on how the
            school operates. Always do your research ahead of time when it comes to your school’s rules on their
            dormitories and residence halls.
          </p>

          <h2>Apartments</h2>
          <p>
            Usually considered off-campus and not supported by the university or college that you plan on attending,
            apartments can provide a unique experience that is different from what you can find in a dorm. If your
            school of choice allows you to live off-campus, apartment hunting and living can give students a more
            realistic environment that they would face once graduating from college. This puts the responsibility solely
            in the hands of the student to price out local apartments, schedule tours ahead of time, and find roommates
            who are also interested in living off-campus as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of paying a fixed rate given by your university, college apartments will require monthly payments
            for rent, and for some complexes, include separate water, power, internet, and parking bills that will also
            have to be paid monthly either towards your landlord or the provider. Apartments can sometimes be less
            expensive compared to residence halls which can make them the more favorable choice to students, or more
            expensive if it includes more amenities and is in a prime location that the residence halls didn’t offer
            (Unigo, 2023).
          </p>
          <p>
            As distance can play a big role in the price of your apartment, make sure you are aware of how far campus is
            in relation to your apartment. This could mean learning the bus system, finding your subway/train stops,
            getting a campus parking pass, bringing a bike, or be okay with walking. Be aware of costs that may be
            added, especially when bringing your car, that could mean paying your school a monthly parking pass in
            addition to regular school costs (Fay, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            But more than likely, with the independence of off-campus housing, apartments include a full kitchen, a
            private bathroom, and generally, individualized bedrooms. This gives students more freedom with apartments,
            may it be selecting furniture and decorations, inviting friends over, leaving and exiting whenever you want,
            as well as the lack of rules and regulations set by the university staff (Marie, 2018). But before making a
            big commitment, make sure you have a quick way to get in contact with your landlord or the building
            supervisor and maintenance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This could be a big deal when discussing lease options or repairs, especially if you don’t like your
            roommate anymore or need major fixes, as each apartment may have lenient or strict rules about breaking
            their contract or getting work done to the rented space.
          </p>

          <h2>Commuting from Home</h2>
          <p>
            If you already live relatively close to the school you plan on attending and are comfortable or would like
            to stay home, commuting from home to school provides the best economical option, but may feel like you are
            missing out on the “college experience”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Commuting may feel uncommon, but there is definitely a large group of students that commute especially if
            they live in the area. And while attending school, you have the comfort of knowing you will always have a
            bed, access to food, are able to do your laundry, and are near your loved ones. This definitely cuts out
            some of the finances that may come with options closer to your school of choice, but this also means having
            that enriching “college life” may not be the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            This option would be the go-to option for community college students, as the majority of community colleges
            don’t have housing provided by the school, but in terms of four year colleges and universities, students may
            find that commuting limits their ability to have a large social life, interference with attending club
            meetings, or even lack of time to explore the area with friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then again, if you are in a financial bind but really want to attend school, the one expense to consider is
            cutting housing by staying home, as that can really jump the price tag (University of the People, 2020).
            Just make sure ahead of time that there is a planned transportation method that works for you, either it
            being driving, taking the bus system, finding your subway stop, or accessing your local train schedule.
            These methods of transportation may accumulate in daily costs, so keep that in mind if you choose to commute
            from home.
